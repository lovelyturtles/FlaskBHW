# Black Wings Hacks 2023 - Team SAKA

### Description: 
Our Black Wings Hacks project is a website which allows women to enter their zipcodes and find doctors near them who are recommended by other women. 

### Running the project
- Input these commands into the terminal (make sure you have pip or pip3 installed):
- sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
- virtualenv env
- source env/bin/activate
- pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy
- python3 app.py
- you can then type in localhost:5000 into your web browser to see our site

### Team:
- Anna Poon (back-end developer)
- Susie Kihaile (back-end developer)
- Kaya Lee (front-end developer)
- Autumn Bertram (front-end developer)

### Techologies used:
- Version control: Github
- Frameworks: Flask
- Languages: Python, HTML/CSS

### Project Goal:
Women (particularly Black and POC) are often treated unfairly in the healthcare industry, subject to implicit bias. Our search engine finds physicians rated highly by women for women based on zip code and specialty. In the healthcare industry, treatment is personal, and our goal is to make the process as fair as possible.

### Project Components:
- Mock-up created using Figma
- Front-end built using HTML/CSS
- Back-end built using Python/Flask
- Zip code lookup tool on landing page
- Web scraper in progress
